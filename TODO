Connector
 check features
 autoreversal - feature based
 allow different hardcoded params based on paymentType (at the moment all params are sent or not)
 request paymentType mapping / logic for data translation
 is it possible to reduce 'shopperReturn and internal-to-external' to redirect with handleAction=true or not

Interface
 Unflatten to PP XML
 pretty print PIA

workflow - reply to callback with URL for connector to redirect with
workflow - sendNotification and get URL from CTPE

implement OPP, Klarna and Inicis (in 10 mins), end to end! Iyizco has custom logic.. if parameter is set, ignore redirect page (example implemented on redirect page?)


Proposal:

presentation of issue vs solution
  - object orientated vs data orientated
  - polymorphism
-demo of PIA interface with connector documentation made from PIA
~Add a new connector from the interface
-Make updates to the connector
-Auto test connector based on PIA data

Roll out idea: 

Use this as playground builder
Build all new connectors this way
Migrate all other connectors
Hook this 'Generic' connector up to PAYPIPE_CC or OPP connector





Later
session timeout etc
how does the 3d connector work? does it send a request to the original, or is that CTPE?
test flattener against parameterErrors
different request and response mapping formats
   xml request / response
   iso8583 binary
 "special case" function call (for complex logic such as if the amount is 0, enter this field) - but maybe amount is zero would be different transaction type
  could connectors be .ini file http://php.net/function.parse-ini-file / http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6411656/how-to-create-php-files-using-php 
 TODOs
 combine workflow and paymenttypes?
 hook up tests - have unit tests and integration tests
 should be easy to update edit to be like add
 sahfor.com (or amazon) basic build / release infrastructure (github? ftp?)
 update 'ctpe' for redirect status
